    "(Q): Bombay hospitality Ltd. operates a franchise model for producing exotic Norwegian dinners throughout New England. The operating cost for a franchise in a week (W) is given by the equation W = $1,000 + $5X, where X represents the number of units produced in a week. Recent feedback from restaurant owners suggests that this cost model may no longer be accurate, as their observed weekly operating costs are higher.\n",
    "Objective:\n",
    "To investigate the restaurant owners' claim about the increase in weekly operating costs using hypothesis testing.\n",
    "Data Provided:\n",
    "•\tThe theoretical weekly operating cost model: W = $1,000 + $5X\n",
    "•\tSample of 25 restaurants with a mean weekly cost of Rs. 3,050\n",
    "•\tNumber of units produced in a week (X) follows a normal distribution with a mean (μ) of 600 units and a standard deviation (σ) of 25 units\n",
    "Assignment Tasks:\n",
    "1. State the Hypotheses statement:\n",
    "2. Calculate the Test Statistic:\n",
    "Use the following formula to calculate the test statistic (t):\n",
    "where:\n",
    "•\tˉxˉ = sample mean weekly cost (Rs. 3,050)\n",
    "•\tμ = theoretical mean weekly cost according to the cost model (W = $1,000 + $5X for X = 600 units)\n",
    "•\tσ = 5*25 units\n",
    "•\tn = sample size (25 restaurants)\n",
    "3. Determine the Critical Value:\n",
    "Using the alpha level of 5% (α = 0.05), determine the critical value from the standard normal (Z) distribution table.\n",
    "4. Make a Decision:\n",
    "Compare the test statistic with the critical value to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "5. Conclusion:\n",
    "Based on the decision in step 4, conclude whether there is strong evidence to support the restaurant owners' claim that the weekly operating costs are higher than the model suggests."
